# Glam

A cross-platform package manager for projects that rock.

Work in progress, not ready for production, breaking changes will happen.

Package PRs welcome.

## Goals

- Easy CI install of glam itself and the packages that it supports
- Full Windows support without relying on PowerShell
- Bring binaries into scope for just one shell, directory or globally.

## Install

Glam currently uses the [Clojure
CLI](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli). This will change: we will
probably move to a GraalVM compiled binary.

Install glam by using this alias in `deps.edn`:

``` clojure
:glam {:extra-deps
       {borkdude/glam {:git/url "https://github.com/borkdude/glam"
                       :sha "92e1a8ec285bb983ad1c2fba28837606c5c99ab6"}
        ;; your-org/your-packages {,,,}
        }
       ;; :extra-paths ["your-packages"]
       :main-opts ["-m" "glam.main"]}
```

Use any later SHA at your convenience or simply clone this project and use
`:local/root`.

Additionally, install a shell helper script by running this and following the instructions:

``` shell
$ clojure -M:glam setup
Include this in your .bashrc analog to finish setup:

source $HOME/.glam/scripts/glam.sh
```

Scripts for Windows will follow. Meanwhile you can replace `glam` invocations by
`clojure -M:glam` and append the printed path to `%PATH%` yourself.

## Usage

Package files like `<package-org>/<package-name>.glam.edn` are discovered via
the classpath (currenly, this will change when moving away from the JVM). This
means that in addition to glam's own packages you can add your own.

E.g. in the glam repo's `packages` directory, there is a
`org.babashka/babashka.glam.edn`.

To install packages for the current shell:

``` clojure
$ glam install clj-kondo/clj-kondo org.babashka/babashka
```

Now `clj-kondo` and `bb` are available:

``` clojure
$ which bb
/Users/borkdude/.glam/repository/org.babashka/babashka/0.2.2/bb
$ which clj-kondo
/Users/borkdude/.glam/repository/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/2020.09.09/clj-kondo
$ bb '(+ 1 2 3)'
6
```

Use `--verbose` for more output, `--force` for re-downloading packages.

### Global

To install packages globally, use `--global` or `-g`.

``` clojure
$ glam install clj-kondo/clj-kondo -g --verbose
...
Wrote /Users/borkdude/.glam/path
```

### Babashka

Glam can also run with [babashka](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka) for fast
startup. You'll need version `0.2.2` or higher. First install it using `glam`:

``` clojure
$ glam org.babashka/babashka -g
```

Glam automatically detects if you have a compatible `bb` installed, so next
`glam` invocations are invoked using `bb`:

``` clojure
$ time (glam)
( glam; )   0.03s  user 0.03s system 93% cpu 0.065 total
```

#### Uberjar

To bundle the package manager and packages into one asset e.g. for moving to another machine, use
babashka's `--uberjar` option:

``` clojure
$ bb -cp $(clojure -Spath -A:glam) -m glam.main --uberjar glam.jar
```

This uberjar contains all packages from the classpath and the package manager
itself. You can then run it from anywhere on your system:

``` clojure
$ mv glam.jar /tmp
$ cd /tmp
$ bb -jar glam.jar install clj-kondo/clj-kondo -g --verbose
...
Wrote /Users/borkdude/.glam/path
/Users/borkdude/.glam/repository/org.babashka/babashka/SNAPSHOT:/Users/borkdude/.glam/repository/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/2020.09.09
```

# Glam

A cross-platform package manager for projects that rock.

Glam offers a flexible way to bring binaries into scope globally or for just one shell.

Work in progress, not ready for production, breaking changes will happen.

Package PRs welcome.

## Install

Install glam by using this alias in `deps.edn`:

``` clojure
:glam {:extra-deps
       {borkdude/glam {:git/url "https://github.com/borkdude/glam"
                       :sha "4599fb019deae9418d76a9996ae19b4003f3cc96"}
        ;; your-org/your-packages {,,,}
        }
       ;; :extra-paths ["your-packages"]
       :main-opts ["-m" "glam.main"]}
```

Use any later SHA at your convenience or simply clone this project and use
`:local/root`.

Additionally, install a shell helper script by running this and following the instructions:

``` shell
$ clojure -M:glam setup
Include this in your .bashrc analog to finish setup:

source $HOME/.glam/scripts/glam.sh
```

Scripts for Windows will follow. Meanwhile you can replace `glam` invocations by `clojure -M:glam`.

## Usage

Package files like `<package-org>/<package-name>.glam.edn` are discovered via the classpath.

E.g. in the glam repo's `packages` directory, there is `org.babashka/babashka.glam.edn`:

``` clojure
{:package/name org.babashka/babashka
 :package/description ""
 :package/version "0.2.1"
 :package/license ""
 :package/artifacts
 [{:os/name "Mac.*"
   :os/arch "x86_64"
   :artifact/url "https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/releases/download/v0.2.1/babashka-0.2.1-macos-amd64.zip"
   :artifact/executables ["bb"]}
  {:os/name "Linux.*"
   :os/arch "amd64"
   :artifact/url "https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/releases/download/v0.2.1/babashka-0.2.1-linux-amd64.zip"
   :artifact/executables ["bb"]}
  {:os/name "Windows.*"
   :os/arch "amd64"
   :artifact/url "https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/releases/download/v0.2.1/babashka-0.2.1-windows-amd64.zip"
   :artifact/executables ["bb.exe"]}]}
```

To install packages for the current shell:

``` clojure
$ glam install clj-kondo/clj-kondo org.babashka/babashka
```

Now `clj-kondo` and `bb` are available:

``` clojure
$ which bb
/Users/borkdude/.glam/repository/org.babashka/babashka/0.2.1/bb
$ which clj-kondo
/Users/borkdude/.glam/repository/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/2020.09.09/clj-kondo
$ bb '(+ 1 2 3)'
6
```

Use `--verbose` for more output, `--force` for re-downloading packages.

### Global

To install packages globally, use `--global` or `-g`.

``` clojure
$ glam install clj-kondo/clj-kondo -g --verbose
...
Wrote /Users/borkdude/.glam/path
```

### Babashka

Glam can also run with [babashka](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka) for fast startup. Currently you will need the latest `0.2.2-SNAPSHOT` version. First install it using `glam`:

``` clojure
$ glam org.babashka/babashka@0.2.2-SNAPSHOT -g
```

Glam automatically detects if you have a compatible `bb` installed, so future
`glam` invocations are invoked using `bb`:

``` clojure
$ time (glam)
( glam; )   0.03s  user 0.03s system 93% cpu 0.065 total
```

#### Uberjar

To bundle the package manager and packages into one asset e.g. for moving to another machine, use
babashka's `--uberjar` option:

``` clojure
$ bb -cp $(clojure -Spath -A:glam) -m glam.main --uberjar glam.jar
```

This uberjar contains all packages from the classpath and the package manager
itself. You can then run it from anywhere on your system:

``` clojure
$ mv glam.jar /tmp
$ cd /tmp
$ bb -jar glam.jar install clj-kondo/clj-kondo -g --verbose
...
Wrote /Users/borkdude/.glam/path
/Users/borkdude/.glam/repository/org.babashka/babashka/SNAPSHOT:/Users/borkdude/.glam/repository/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/2020.09.09
```
